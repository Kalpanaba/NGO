        We at Raju Vegesna Foundation believe in the core values of giving and the pure joy of working selflessly for the development of communities. For us, helping the needy and disadvantaged is not merely a corporate social responsibility but a deep-felt personal commitment to spread happiness among rural communities.
        <br /><br />
        In our own small way, we have been contributing to the betterment of society through aiding in the empowerment of women, taking care of the elderly and infirm, supporting the provision of safe drinking water, conducting health camps and awareness workshops on health issues, and promoting sports tournaments for the elderly.
        <br /><br />
        The Foundation is our humble contribution; an effort to give back to society through various initiatives while always keeping the communityâ€™s welfare on top of our mind.
